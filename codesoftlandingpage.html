                    <summary><h6 style="color: blue;border: 1px solid grey;padding: 10px;">Uh,but such courses are already available for almost half or even a quarter of your fee...Why is your course highly priced?</h6></summary>
                    <p>You sure have done your research, eh? Awesome!</p>
                    <p>Yes! Such courses are available even for dirt-cheap prices. No denying that!</p>
                    <p>But we are charging a premium price for 3 reasons:</p>
                    <p>Unlike other training programs, we simply don’t impart knowledge. We will teach you the EXACT skills that will get a good IT job.</p>
                    <p>Prepare for interviews</p>
                    <p>Create an online profile that attracts recruiters from top IT companies</p>
                    <p>Teach soft skills</p>
                    <p>Talks by real-time professionals</p>
                    <p>Daily challenges</p>
                    <p>Use on-trend tools that are currently recommended in the IT industry. (Other courses, don’t teach you the tools)</p>
                    <p>And a lot more!</p>

                    <summary><h6 style="color: blue;border: 1px solid grey;padding: 10px;">Do you also teach any new technologies like AI,ML or Blockchain? Arent they the in-demand technologies?</h6></summary>
                    <p>Nope. We cannot say so.</p>
                    <p>They are new technologies.</p>
                    <p>But the cold truth is those technologies don’t offer jobs for freshers.</p>
                    <p>That’s why we are focusing on Full Stack Developer, which is a reliable way to land a lucrative IT job in top companies.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, if you are seeking to learn new technologies, we are not for you. We’re interested in only enrolling people who want to become a Full Stack Developer.</p>
